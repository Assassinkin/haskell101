to foce haskell to treat a var in a certain way use: 
(123 :: Float) then 123 will be considered float


let x = 'h' this wont work cause the double ' is used for char not strings


use :type (:t) to get the type of a variable
use :info  to get info on some variable type (Int Float etc ...)
use :help for the full list


A list is an empty list "[]" or a variable appended to another list
1: [2] outputs [1, 2]
